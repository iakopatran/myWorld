#Sharing negative images leads to a cycle of sharing negative images
-Romanticise self-harm/suicide  
-Getting “likes” and seeing similar negative images reinforces the negative behavior  
-Being a part of a negative community
#No “real-life” support community => search for virtual community (not the best solution; should find licensed professionals)
-Community with shared morals/experiences
#Tumblr now points to mental health resources when a post is tagged “self-harm,” etc.
-Easier to exit out of resource prompt than to seek the resources available.  
-Easier to receive reinforcement from negative community
